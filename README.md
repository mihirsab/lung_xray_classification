# lung_xray_classification
This project focuses on classifying lung X-rays into four categories: COVID-19, viral pneumonia, lung opacity, and normal lungs using CNN architectures like EfficientNetB1, ResNet101, and VGG16. The goal is to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize healthcare resource allocation during medical crises like COVID-19.
